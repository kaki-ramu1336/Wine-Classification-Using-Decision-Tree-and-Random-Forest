# Introduction

* This mini project focuses on classifying wine samples into different classes using machine learning techniques. Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms are implemented to analyze and compare their performance.

# Problem Statement

* To classify wine samples into three classes (0, 1, 2) based on 13 chemical features using machine learning models.

 # Objective

* To build classification models using Decision Tree and Random Forest
* To compare model performance
* To analyze bias–variance behavior
* To visualize feature importance

# Dataset Description

* Dataset: Wine Dataset (scikit-learn)
* Samples: 178
* Features: 13 chemical attributes
* Classes: 3 wine cultivars
* Missing Values: None

# Algorithms Used

* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier

# Methodology

* Load and split the dataset
* Train Decision Tree and Random Forest models
* Evaluate models using accuracy and classification report
* Visualize results and compare performance

# Results

* Random Forest achieved higher accuracy than Decision Tree
* Ensemble learning reduced overfitting
* Feature importance highlighted key attributes

# Conclusion

* Random Forest outperformed Decision Tree by providing more stable and accurate predictions for wine classification.
